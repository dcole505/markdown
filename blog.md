# My day 5/26/2020

Today has been an interesting journey to say the least. For starters, I _intentionally_ got up earlier that I have since I can remember. The beginning of my **Epicodus** journey has been filled with new information and a fair bit of anxiety about starting something new.

## What we've covered so far

* Installation of various programs used throughout the course.
* Initiation into the wide (and sometimes confusing) world of Github.
* Basic introduction of Markdown language which is being used to write this here document.

## Conclusions
1. Both of my partners are from different walks of life and skill levels in programming. They are both also very pleasant to be teamed up with.
2. I thought this week would be a cake walk since I felt I had enough of a background to get me going. I was not aware how quickly things would move.
3. Although it will likely be daunting to keep up with the arduous pace of this course, I am confident that if I apply myself fully, **I will succeed**.
